## Installation

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow the steps below for both the frontend (React) and backend (Express).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    
    ```bash
    cd Security-Vault/server
    ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Create a `.env` file in the root of the `server` directory and add the following environment variables:**

    ```env
    - MONGO_URI = "mongodb+srv://username:<password>@cluster0.nbgt3.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
    - SECRET_KEY = "i=UGrwJW8Bdp;twly82YdE=lwl!kav;lguCY/m" (EXAMPLE)
    - PASSWORD_KEY = "7Zrdf1sxdUGrwJW8BdGrwJl!kaE=lyptF0Rfd" (EXAMPLE)
    ```
    Note: Replace the `MONGO_URI` with your MongoDB connection string and generate a unique `SECRET_KEY` and `PASSWORD_KEY` for security purposes.
4. **Start the server:**
    
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    
    ```bash
    cd Security-Vault/client
    ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server:**
    
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Error Handling
- Make sure your frontend should work on port 5173 and backend on 3000, otherwise you need to make changes in backend index.js and need to provide the new frontend url in allowedOrigins. If you are using different port for backend then you need to change the AuthUser.js baseURL in frontend.
- If you encounter any issues while running the application, please feel free to open an issue on this repository. We will be happy to help you troubleshoot the problem.

## Usage
Once the backend and frontend are set up, you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:5173` in your web browser. You can then register a new account or log in with the default credentials:
